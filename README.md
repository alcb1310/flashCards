## A capstone project
> 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
> By: Angela Yu
> Hosted by UDEMY

### Features
The objective of this project is to make a study flash cards where
in one side of the card it displays de text in French and in the other
side it displays in English

The cards will be shown randomly, first in the French side and after 
5 seconds it will turn to the English word.  If the user guessed the 
english word correctly, he/she will press the check mark and otherwise 
will press the cross.

If the user presses the check, it means he/she knows the word, so it will
remove it from the data file, so it will not appear again
